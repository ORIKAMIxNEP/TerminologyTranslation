Trilateration
Surveying to determine position and height. The distance of each side of a triangle drawn with three measuring points is checked and surveyed. In the past, this method was not used due to its inaccuracy, but in recent years, instruments that can measure distances with high accuracy, such as lightwave rangefinders, have appeared, and this has made it possible.

平面測量
へいめんそくりょう
heimensokuryo
Plane surveying
survey of a small area. It does not take into account that the earth is a sphere (curved plane), but assumes that the land is flat.

Geodetic surveying
A surface that treats the ground surface as a surface considering curvature.

距離測量
きょりそくりょう
kyorisokuryo
Distance survey
It is a survey that measures the distance between two points on the ground and, together with angular surveying, is a fundamental element of various ground survey methods.

角測量
かくそくりょう
kakusokuryo
Measurement of angle
It is a survey that measures the angle between the directions from one measuring point on the ground to a target in two directions. Triangulation and polygonal surveying are also types of angular surveying.

Leveling
A survey to determine the height of each point on the ground. The direct leveling method uses a level and staff to obtain the specific height between two points based on the difference between the readings of the vertical and horizontal readings of the vertical and horizontal staffs at the two points. There are two types of direct level surveying and triangulation.

Detail surveying
Surveying is performed to map the entire topography and landforms in detail. There are several methods, such as the intersection method, the right-of-way method, the radial method, and the bearing method. Which of these methods is used depends on the topographic and geographic conditions.

基本測量
きほんそくりょう
kihonsokuryo
Basic survey
It is one of the terms in the Survey Act, and refers to ""a survey that forms the basis of all surveys and is conducted by the Geographical Survey Institute"" (Article 4 of the Survey Act).
,
公共測量
こうきょうそくりょう
kokyosokuryo
Public survey
One of the terms in the Survey Act, which means the following surveys other than basic surveying (Article 5 of the Survey Act).

基準点測量
きじゅんてんそくりょう
kijuntensokuryo
Point surveying
A new reference point is established based on an existing reference point (triangulation point, electronic reference point, etc.), and the location (coordinates and height) of the new point is determined.
