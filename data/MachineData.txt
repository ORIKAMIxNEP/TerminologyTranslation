Drilling machine
A drilling machine is a machine tool for accurately drilling holes in various materials. Place the material to be machined on a table, rotate a cutting tool such as a drill or reamer attached to the spindle, and lower the spindle toward the material to make a hole.

Welding
Welding is a fabrication process that joins materials, usually metals or thermoplastics, by using high heat to melt the parts together and allowing them to cool, causing fusion.

Vernier caliper
It consists of a main scale and a vernier scale that slides along it, and is a measuring instrument that measures the thickness and diameter of an object. The main scale and vernier scale have claws that can be used to pinch the target from the outside or hit the inside of the target.

塑性変形

Plastic deformation
After applying an external force to the object to deform it, the deformation remains even if the external force is removed. It occurs when the magnitude of the external force exceeds the elastic limit.

Elastic deformation
When a deformation that occurs in a solid to which a force is applied returns to its original state after the force is removed, this deformation is called elastic deformation. Deformation of an object that receives a force smaller than its elastic limit.

Stress
This is the physical quantity used to represent the magnitude and direction of action of the force generated inside an object. It is used to determine the magnitude of the burden on object deformation and destruction.

Strain
It is a measure of the deformation state of an object in continuum mechanics and shows how much the mass point in the object is displaced per unit length of the reference state of the object.

Alloy
An alloy is a mixture of chemical elements of which at least one is a metal. Unlike chemical compounds with metallic bases, an alloy will retain all the properties of a metal in the resulting material, such as electrical conductivity, ductility, opacity, and luster, but may have properties that differ from those of the pure metals, such as increased strength or hardness.

Sheet matal
Sheet metal is metal formed into thin, flat pieces, usually by an industrial process. Sheet metal is one of the fundamental forms used in metalworking, and it can be cut and bent into a variety of shapes.

Wear
Wear is the damaging, gradual removal or deformation of material at solid surfaces. Causes of wear can be mechanical (e.g., erosion) or chemical (e.g., corrosion). The study of wear and related processes is referred to as tribology.

Tolerance
Tolerances set the allowable deviation from assigned dimensions. Not setting a tolerance in a critical area may render the part unusable according to the design intent, as each fabrication method comes with a certain level of inaccuracy.

Steel
Steel is an alloy made up of iron with added carbon to improve its strength and fracture resistance compared to other forms of iron. Many other elements may be present or added.

Bending
In applied mechanics, bending (also known as flexure) characterizes the behavior of a slender structural element subjected to an external load applied perpendicularly to a longitudinal axis of the element.

Shearing
In continuum mechanics, shearing refers to the occurrence of a shear strain, which is a deformation of a material substance in which parallel internal surfaces slide past one another. It is induced by a shear stress in the material.

Cutting
Cutting has been at the core of manufacturing throughout history. For metals many methods are used and can be grouped by the physical phenomenon used. It is the process of producing a work piece by removing unwanted material from a block of metal, in the form of chips.

Polishing
Polishing is the process of creating a smooth and shiny surface by rubbing it or by applying a chemical treatment, leaving a clean surface with a significant specular reflection (still limited by the index of refraction of the material according to the Fresnel equations).In some materials (such as metals, glasses, black or transparent stones), polishing is also able to reduce diffuse reflection to minimal values.

Measurement
Measurement is the process of comparing unknown magnitude of certain parameter with the known predefined standard of that parameter. For the measurements results to be accurate, two conditions should be met. Scope of Measurement Measurements are one of crucial parts of not only mechanical engineering but all types of engineering fields.
