Drilling machine
A drilling machine is a machine tool for accurately drilling holes in various materials. Place the material to be machined on a table, rotate a cutting tool such as a drill or reamer attached to the spindle, and lower the spindle toward the material to make a hole.

Welding
Welding is a fabrication process that joins materials, usually metals or thermoplastics, by using high heat to melt the parts together and allowing them to cool, causing fusion.

Vernier caliper
It consists of a main scale and a vernier scale that slides along it, and is a measuring instrument that measures the thickness and diameter of an object. The main scale and vernier scale have claws that can be used to pinch the target from the outside or hit the inside of the target.

Plastic deformation
After applying an external force to the object to deform it, the deformation remains even if the external force is removed. It occurs when the magnitude of the external force exceeds the elastic limit.

Elastic deformation
When a deformation that occurs in a solid to which a force is applied returns to its original state after the force is removed, this deformation is called elastic deformation. Deformation of an object that receives a force smaller than its elastic limit.

Stress
This is the physical quantity used to represent the magnitude and direction of action of the force generated inside an object. It is used to determine the magnitude of the burden on object deformation and destruction.

Strain
It is a measure of the deformation state of an object in continuum mechanics and shows how much the mass point in the object is displaced per unit length of the reference state of the object.
